### Please Stop Sending Me Your Shitty Word Document
This reading is a post made by a man named Marc Scott, who discussed with great anger the detriments of Microsoft Words, and bemoans the popularity of the application. This passage is broken into six sections (not including the intro), which include:
* *I Don't Have Word Installed:* Where Scott explains that .docx files only work for Microsoft Word, which results in more work for the receiving party if they haven't installed Word.
* *Plain Text Should Be Plain:* In which Scott questions the purpose of using a Word Document if the majority of the work is just text. If that is the case, then it would be easier to just make it a .txt file. 
* *Are You Really That Good a Designer:* Scott acknowledges that using Word could be justified, but only if the creator of the document knew exactly how to maximize the design aspects of word. Otherwise, it's pointless.
* *Tables Grrrr!:* Where Scott expresses his distaste for table in general, but especially through word. He points out that at least HTML tables are easy to manage, unlike Word.
* *What's With the Crud?:* In a similarily anger manner, Scott asks his audience to avoid sending any additional features like animation or 3D Word Art, because it results in more frustration on his part because he cannot see any of it. 
* *A Heartfelt Plea:* In this wrap-up of his post, Scott asks his audience to find other ways to make their content accessible, and to avoid Word as much as possible. To quote him directly,
>Perhaps you could save the file as a .txt, .rtf or PDF. Just spare a thought for those of us that choose not to use Microsoft Word, and respect our right not to do so.
Oh... and learn to write in sodding Markdown.

### Why Microsoft Word Must Die
Similar to the first reading, the second reading is also a coder bemoaning the use of Microsoft, a man by the name of Charlie Stross. Stross has worked with word processors and text editors for 30 years, and in the beginning, the ideal combination for a program was a text file, containing embedded commands that could be edited with a text editor and fed to a variety of tools. Programmers then strived to develop a tool that hid these complex features from the author called a Word Processor. Around this time, though, Microsoft grew enormously, and began to dominate the market. But what began happening is that they would absorb resources from their competitors and throw it into their own software. To quote Stross:
>Its interface is convoluted, baroque, making the easy difficult and the difficult nearly impossible to achieve. It guarantees job security for the guru, not transparency for the zen adept who wishes to focus on the task in hand, not the tool with which the task is to be accomplished.

This made Microsoft Office almost impossible to sustain, and Stross believes it's demise is destined.  
### Markdown: Markup That's Downright Simple
With this reading, we are introduced to a new type of text modifier, Markdown. The author, Erik Martin, outlines the benefits of understanding the language of Markdown, which was created by John Gruber in 2004. The article is broken up into the following sections:
* *Markdown Can Make Online Writing Easier Than HTML and Other Markup Languages:* Which introduces the simplicity of Markdown in a technological world that is constantly becoming complex. 
* *Dummy-Proof Text:* The wonderful and god-like Carlos Evia at Virginia Tech is interviewed in this section on the simple, shorthand of the Markdown language.
>Years ago, I started coding websites with HTML and then structuring documentation with XML, but Markdown allows me to use plain text for similar purposes. My Markdown files can become HTML and XML deliverables with one or two lines of commands or a few keystrokes.

* *Simple By Design:* Markdown was created for the specific process of being simplistic. This section emphasizes the combination of the shorthand and the basic commands and design, as well as the use through any text editor. Plus, there are many additional tools created to expand Gruber's original Markdown. 
* *One Size Does Not Fit All:* Again, the gracious and honorable Evia is referenced to warn users of Markdown that it isn't an end-all-be-all. 
>Markdown is for textual content. If an author is also in charge of graphic design, page layout, or multimodal content, then the Markdown text needs a second or even third layer of processing to be ready for end users. Fortunately, there are many commercial and open source applications that take care of some of those steps, but there is frequently some heavy author work behind a final product that was built with pure Markdown.

But, ultimately, Markdown is still designed to be a simple application.
* *The More Things Change The More They Stay The Same:* This section summarises the other sections, and says this: that no matter how far we advance technologically, Markdown will still last, as plain text will never go away. This is because programmers follow the KISS rule: Keep it simple, stupid.


### Guide to Podcasting
To quote the article itself, 
> This report aims to explain why podcasts matter to digital journalism: as our world shifts to one of mobile consumption, podcasts represent a form of mobile-first content that engages with audiences in ways that no other mobile media has previously.

The author, Vanessa Quirk, outlines the art of the podcast into seven sections following the introduction. This includes:
* Why Podcasting Matters
* Where We Are Today
* Revenue Streams
* Case Studies
* Operating Philosophies
* Key Unresolved Issues

### Podcasting Timeline
This reading is just what the title says: a timeline of podcasting. Starting in March 1999 to present day, this timeline highlights key moments of podcasting progression. The podcast story starts with the prototype of the RSS feed being launched by Netscape, which allows publishers to syndicate content automatically. Dave Winer and Adam Curry then included audio to RSS in 2000. The first podcast is born in September of 2003 by Winer, which is the oldest, still-running podcast. Thus, in 2004, the boom of podcasts begins,
>And, by 2009, 43% of Americans are aware of the term podcasting. 22% have listened to a podcast.

By June of 2013, Apple announced that one billion podcast subscriptions had been achieved, with kicked off the second boom. Podcasts have only grown in popularity over time, and continue to do so in 2017.
